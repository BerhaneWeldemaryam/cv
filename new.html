		<p>The world is full of <b>terror</b>. There is <strong>war, hunger, natural and man made problems, climate changes, immigration, killings and terrors,</strong> etc. Example, in Ethiopia the <i>social fabric</i> of the people is teared apart. There is <em>tension</em> between different <mark>ethnic groups, religious groups and between different political groups</mark>. This issue could lead the country to <small>disintegrate</small>. Ethiopia right now is almost a <b>faild state</b>. If the <sub>current</sub> government continues in <sup>power</sup>, for sure the old nation will become a history in the near future. Specially the <b><q>genocide</q></b> commited in Tigray will have a long lasting consequence in the future of the genocider nation.</p>
